<h2>Contribution</h2>
The first dungeon is recreated by me and Jiajun Wang with tight collaberation. I completed the room transistion, weapon and health system, as well as the game progress control of the first dungeon. I also designed and implemented through our custom dungeon level with many helpful advices from Jiajun. I also drawn all the new assets used in our custom level.
